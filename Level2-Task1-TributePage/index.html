            <p>Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time. He began his football journey at a young age with Newell's Old Boys before moving to Spain at 13 to join FC Barcelona, where he received treatment for a growth hormone deficiency.
                Messi made his first-team debut for Barcelona at 17 and quickly became a pivotal player. Over his illustrious career with the club, he won a record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. He is also the all-time top scorer in La Liga history, with 474 goals.
                In addition to his club success, Messi has earned numerous individual accolades, including a record eight Ballon d'Or awards. After leaving Barcelona in 2021, he played for Paris Saint-Germain before joining Inter Miami in July 2023. Messi also led the Argentina national team to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and won an Olympic gold medal in 2008. His skill, vision, and goal-scoring ability have made him a global icon in the sport.
